The year started with me looking for new ways to approach my personal and professional development.

I usually take an informal self-guided approach to learning, where I rapidly gain a simple understanding of the key ideas and framework of a topic, before diving right in to find practical ways to apply and learn by doing.  In practice, that usually starts with an [online search](https://duckduckgo.com/) for and reading multiple articles/journals that already distil down the key ideas.

Using this approach and following my curiosity - I tumbled down an online rabbit hole...

Some of the *rabbit hole* highlights:
* Daniel Bourke's [Creating your own data science curriculum](https://www.mrdbourke.com/how-to-create-your-own-data-science-curriculum-with-coursera-in-2021/)
* [nesslabs.com/faq](https://nesslabs.com/faq) - a virtual gym for the mind offering neuroscience-based content, community and coaching
* Steve Cheney's [how to be discovered](https://stevecheney.com/on-how-to-be-discovered/)
* I discovered I like [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) for ideas and motivation relating to startups, creativity, self-development.

The biggest disovery for me was the concept of ***learning in public***.

If you haven't heard of it, head over to Shaun 'Swyx' Wang's [learn in public article][swyx-lip] for a compelling perspective, and related links (*warning: rabbit hole ahead*).

Put simply, with the internet and online services now freely available, it's possible to learn in public by sharing your thoughts and lessons as you go, helping those who are step or two behind you on the trail, and accelerating your learning in the process.

Some people are simply posting updates on social media, others are writing articles, or even video tutorials and email newsletters.

My learning has always been done the in private -  old-fashioned way.  The idea of accelerated learning sounds exciting and only slightly triggers my imposter syndrome.

The question I asked myself is whether whether my contribution would be adding [signal, or bloating the internet with more  more noise](https://fs.blog/2012/05/noise-and-signal-nassim-taleb/).  In the end, one factor convinced me to try the #learninpublic path:

*If it wasn't for the people already learning in public, I wouldn't have had access to a plethora of online resources - from Q&A's to rich email newsletter's to full blown video tutorials.*

With these resources and sources of information, I've made my life better.

From that point of view, if I can pass on learning opportunities to the next person, or even provide the breadcrumbs from someone pick up the trail on a topic that turns out to be helpful or meaningful to then, then it will be time well spent.

So to start my journey, I've set up this website for my content.  To do that, I learnt how to use git bash, spin up a site using jekyll, and host it for free on github pages - stay tuned for my post on how I did it.
